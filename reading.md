# reading list

## technical papers and books
* [intel x86 considered harmful](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/x86_harmful.pdf) (started 10/15)
* [an empirical analysis of email delivery
  security](http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/imc/2015/papers/p27.pdf) (finished 10/15): notable/belated research on the failure of STARTTLS opportunistic security. particularly scary: hotels, airports, and airlines have been found to perform STARTTLS stripping. i would like to see a follow-up scan estimating the percentage of STARTTLS connections with fradulent certificates.
* [getting started with bluetooth low
  energy](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781491900550/) (started 10/15)
* [advanced programming in the unix environment](http://www.apuebook.com/) (started 8/15): taught me a lot of fundamental things about UNIX. i put this in the "really dry bedtime reading" category though.

## other nonfiction
* [trauma and recovery: the aftermath of
  violence](http://www.amazon.com/Trauma-Recovery-Aftermath-Violence-Political/dp/0465061710) (in progress): reading this for book club
* [midwestern nice: a tribute to a sincere and suffocating way of
  life](https://www.thrillist.com/lifestyle/nation/my-life-living-midwestern-nice): literally couldn't make it through this in one sitting because it brought up so many overwhelming memories of growing up in the midwest.
* [attached](http://www.amazon.com/Attached-Science-Adult-Attachment-YouFind/dp/1585429139) (in progress): recommended by a friend. i think it's alright. i find myself applying attachment theory to all sorts of social situations now that i've read half of it. although it is frustratingly geared towards classical relationship arcs (monogamous, marriage-centric, equating escalation of closeness with positive progress), it's taught me a lot about how i compare to other people.
* [POC||GTFO 0x08](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo08.pdf): my
  first poc||gtfo. i loved it dearly. inspired a couple of my recent projects.
* [9/11: the view from the
  midwest](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/9-11-the-view-from-the-midwest-20110819): i reread this every 9/11.
* [david lynch keeps his head](http://www.lynchnet.com/lh/lhpremiere.html): one
  of my favorite david foster wallace articles. has a lot of immensely reusable
  quotes like "a good 65 percent of the people in metropolitan bus terminals
  between the hours of midnight and 6 A.M. tend to qualify as Lynchian
  figures-grotesque, enfeebled, flamboyantly unappealing, freighted with a woe
  out of all proportion to evident circumstances ... a class of public-place
  humans I've privately classed, via Lynch, as 'insistently fucked up.'"
* [zami: a new spelling of my
  name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zami:_A_New_Spelling_of_My_Name): audre
  lorde is an incredible and highly underrated writer. a painful autobiography
  that ends happily despite the odds.

## fiction
* [little brother](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/) (in progress):
  my first doctorow book. some parts are confusingly close to reality in SF.
* [valencia](http://www.amazon.com/Valencia-Michelle-Tea/dp/158005238X): i wish
  i lived in this version of san francisco.
* [the
  panopticon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Panopticon-Novel-Jenni-Fagan/dp/0385347952): one of the best novels i've ever read. i am in awe of the main character.
* [the cloud
  atlas](http://www.amazon.com/The-Cloud-Atlas-Liam-Callanan/dp/0385336950):
  confusingly, this is *not* the same book as "Cloud Atlas." i, like many
  readers, read all of it before realizing that I read the wrong book. it was
  good though. super sad.
