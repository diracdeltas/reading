you know things are getting better when you walk away from the hotel where you
just gave two presentations wearing your best pretense of
holding-it-togetherness while inside you felt shakey, hungover, and insane.
remember how long you stood there, smiling and rationing weak handshakes while
pretending you believed that you had a future? promise yourself you’re never
doing that again. you walk away from the volatile company of people who made
you feel shitty about yourself without trying to and into the car of someone
who looks like they could be your new friend. you drive down the street and
pack your bags, take off your stupid clothes and pull on a grey tshirt. now
you’re driving down Highway 5 towards LA, the hills are honey-colored, the
mountains crashing into sunset sky with symphonic grace, your insecurities
start to crack like chipped gold paint. you pick at your wrecked fingernails
and start to feel like you might have the vaguest idea of what to do with
yourself tomorrow morning. then your new friend turns on the stereo and says,
“do you want to hear a song i wrote? it’s about how my mom was a cunt.” you
say, sure.

they told me not to, so i'm taking the bus from downtown LA to LAX. on my
right, a man is asking everyone except me for 50 cents. everyone except me is
a black guy.

the bus stops for the zillionth time and a high schooler in a white t-shirt
with some arm tattoos gets on. he sits down to my left and asks me what my arm tattoo
is of. i start explaining particle physics. he asks what the hell i'm doing on
the bus in LA. "hanging out," i shrug. he thinks i am 19 years old and
smart and beautiful and cool so he asks me out. i say sorry i live in san
francisco, i am on my way to the airport, and just for the record, i am 24
years old. the guy next to him hears this and high-fives me because he used to
live in oakland. the kid asks me if i could please change my flight so we can
chill. i say no. then he says, "you are the dopest girl i've ever met. imma get
off the bus and call my friend and tell him 'bout you." i say thanks. he
remembers i'm not from south LA so he tells me it's a real bad neighborhood and
i should not talk to anyone if i get off the bus here. i say thank you, that information may be relevant to my immediate perambulations. the kid is obviously a bit
sad we can't hang out, so we say our goodbyes as he is getting off the bus to
go to his friend's house. i tell him he is young and i'm sure he will meet lots
more people on the bus in the future.

the guy from Oakland starts to play rap music at full volume on his phone. the
man on my right leans over to him and whispers, "50 Cent?" i tell him, no sir, i believe
this track is by Biggie. "that's right," he nods, as the guy from Oakland hands
him 50 cents.
